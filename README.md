Looking for fingerprints in beacon frames

The basic idea (currently) is to compare the sequence of frame tags to know sequences from firmware different firmware versions.

This project will be very dependant on creating a vast dictionary of known firmware versions.

Currently every SSID that is know is in a dictionary. This is very ram intensive. A better solution may be posible.
